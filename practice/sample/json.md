# JSON Practice Tasks

This repository contains a set of JSON practice tasks to help you master various operations related to JSON data in JavaScript. Each task is designed to enhance your understanding and skills in handling JSON objects and arrays.

## Tasks

### 1. Calculate Total Amount âœ…
Create a function that calculates the `totalAmount` by summing up the product of `price` and `quantity` for each item in the `products` array.

### 2. Apply Discount âœ…
Implement logic to apply a discount if the `totalAmount` exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., $1000). Update the `finalAmount` after applying the discount.

### 3. Add a New Product
Write a function to add a new product to the `products` array. The function should accept `id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity` as parameters.

### 4. Update Product Quantity
Develop a function to update the `quantity` of a product in the `products` array, identified by its `id`.

### 5. Remove a Product
Create a function to remove a product from the `products` array by its `id`.

### 6. Sort Products
Add functionality to sort the `products` array either by `price` or `quantity`, depending on a parameter passed to the function.

### 7. Filter Products
Implement a function to filter products based on a price range or quantity threshold.

### 8. Find Most Expensive Product
Write a function to find the product with the highest `price` in the `products` array.

### 9. Calculate Average Price
Add functionality to calculate and return the average price of all products in the cart.

### 10. Convert to JSON String
Serialize the updated object to a JSON string with proper indentation for readability.

### 11. Parse JSON String
Parse a JSON string back into an object and verify its structure by logging it.

### 12. Add User Shipping Address
Extend the `user` object to include a `shippingAddress` field and populate it with a sample address.

### 13. Check Stock Availability
Add a function to check if a specific product by `id` is in stock (quantity > 0).

### 14. Create Order Summary
Generate a summary of the order, including the user name, total items, total amount, discount, and final amount.

### 15. Save Data to Local Storage
Save the serialized JSON string into local storage (if running in a browser environment).

### 16. Load Data from Local Storage
Write a function to load and parse the JSON data from local storage.

### 17. Reset Cart
Create a function to reset the cart, clearing all products and resetting the `totalAmount` and `finalAmount` to zero.
