Here’s a curated list of JavaScript problem-solving questions focused on strings, arrays, objects, and arrays of objects. These exercises range from basic to advanced to help you practice effectively:

---

### **Strings**
1. Write a function to reverse a string.
2. Check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).
3. Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
4. Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
5. Write a function to find the longest word in a given string.
6. Replace all spaces in a string with a hyphen (`-`).
7. Convert a given string to Title Case.
8. Find the frequency of a given character in a string.
9. Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
10. Compress a string by replacing consecutive duplicate characters with their count (e.g., `"aaabbcc"` → `"a3b2c2"`).

### **Arrays**
1. Find the maximum and minimum values in an array.
2. Remove duplicates from an array.
3. Write a function to rotate an array by `k` positions.
4. Find the intersection of two arrays.
5. Check if an array contains a subarray with a sum of 0.
6. Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
7. Find the second largest number in an array.
8. Write a function to move all zeros to the end of an array.
9. Return the indices of two numbers in an array that sum to a target value.
10. Find the missing number in an array of `n` consecutive integers.

### **Objects**
1. Write a function to check if two objects are equal.
2. Convert an object into an array of key-value pairs.
3. Count the frequency of words in a sentence and return an object with the counts.
4. Merge two objects with the same keys by adding their values.
5. Write a function to check if an object is empty.
6. Convert a nested object into a flattened object.
7. Find all the keys in an object whose values are numbers.
8. Write a function to deep clone an object.
9. Group the properties of an object by their value type (e.g., string, number, etc.).
10. Find the most frequent value in an object.

### **Array of Objects**
1. Sort an array of objects by a specific key (e.g., `name` or `age`).
2. Filter an array of objects based on a property value.
3. Write a function to find the object with the maximum value for a given key.
4. Group an array of objects by a property (e.g., group users by age).
5. Create a function to update a specific key's value in all objects in an array.
6. Find duplicates in an array of objects based on a specific key.
7. Write a function to check if all objects in an array have a specific property.
8. Remove objects from an array if they have duplicate values for a specific key.
9. Calculate the sum of a specific property in an array of objects.
10. Write a function to search for an object in an array based on multiple criteria.
