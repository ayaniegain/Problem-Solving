1. Create an array of 5 elements using the Array Constructor.  
2. Create an array of 3 empty slots.  
3. Create an array of 6 elements using Array literals and access the fourth element in the array using its `length` property.  
4. Use the `for` loop on the above array to print elements at odd indices.  
5. Add one element at the front and the end of an array.  
6. Remove an element from the front and the end of an array.  
7. Create an array containing the names of your favorite foods (10 foods). Destructure the 6th food element from the array using destructuring.  
8. Take out the last 8 food items from the above array using Array destructuring. *Hint: Use the rest parameter.*  
9. Clone an Array (Shallow cloning).  
10. Empty an array using its `length` property.  
11. Create an array of 10 elements (numbers 1 to 10). Resize the array to length 6 once you find the number 5. *Hint: Use `for` loop.*  
12. Create an array of 10 elements. Use the `splice()` method to empty the array.  
13. Create an array of 10 elements. Empty the array using the following methods:
    - Using the `length` property
    - Using the `pop()` method
    - Using the `shift()` method
    - Setting the array to `[]`
    - Using the `splice()` method  
    Which of these methods is most efficient and why?  
14. What happens when you concatenate two empty arrays?  
15. How can you check if a value partially matches any of the elements in an Array?  
16. What is the difference between the `slice()` and `splice()` methods?  
17. Create an array of alphanumeric strings. Sort the elements in both ascending and descending orders. Ensure this is done immutably so that the source array is not modified.  
18. Provide examples of sparse and dense arrays.  
19. Provide practical usages of the `.fill()` method.  
20. How do you convert an array to a string?
